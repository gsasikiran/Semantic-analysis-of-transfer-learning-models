# Semantic word similarity

## Objective:
 To detect the robustness of word embeddings of different transfer learning models.
 
## Procedure:
* Input two different sentences
* Tokenizing the sentences into words
* Downloading a word embeddings of a model
* Calculating cosine similarity between the corresponding word embeddings
* Plotting the similarity matrix.

## Example:
